# The following program takes in 2 user entries and verifies if the users are Singaporeans 
# by checking if the first letter of each entry is "S". 
# If the user is a Singaporean, the program prints a welcome home message. 
# Otherwise, it prints a welcome to Singapore message.

# ID = ""

#         print("Welcome to Singapore!")
      
# Task 2.1
# Edit the program so that
# 1.   It takes in 5 entries,[1]
# 2.   It prints the same welcome home message if the first letter of the entry is either "S" or "T".[2]
# 3.   The program counts the total number of Singaporeans in the list.[3]
